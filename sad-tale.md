House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.


some more...

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
begin, and let me assure you he will ___DEFINITELY NOT DIE!___

But then, all of sudden, Muad'dib appears from a distant land atop Shai'hulud and swallows King's Landing whole! and the seven kingdoms begin their process of desertification and spice production. THE SPICE MUST FLOW!!!
